## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

## Bulk Seeder Usage

You can use the Bulk Seeder Artisan command to quickly create or remove large amounts of test data for BlogPost, Developer, RentalResale, and Offplan models.

### Command Syntax

```
php artisan bulk:seed {type} [--count=NUMBER] [--remove] [--force]
```

- `{type}`: The type of records to manage. Options: `blog`, `developer`, `rental`, `offplan`, or `all` (for all models).
- `--count=NUMBER`: Number of records to create (default: 10,000). Only used when creating records.
- `--remove`: Remove all records of the specified type instead of creating them.
- `--force`: Skip confirmation prompts (useful for scripting or automation).

### Examples

#### Create 10,000 Developers
```
php artisan bulk:seed developer --count=10000 --force
```

#### Create 5,000 Rental Resale records
```
php artisan bulk:seed rental --count=5000 --force
```

#### Create 10,000 Blog Posts
```
php artisan bulk:seed blog --count=10000 --force
```

#### Create 10,000 Offplan records
```
php artisan bulk:seed offplan --count=10000 --force
```

#### Create 2,000 records for all models
```
php artisan bulk:seed all --count=2000 --force
```

#### Remove all Developer records
```
php artisan bulk:seed developer --remove --force
```

#### Remove all records for all models
```
php artisan bulk:seed all --remove --force
```

> **Note:** Omit `--force` to receive a confirmation prompt before proceeding.
